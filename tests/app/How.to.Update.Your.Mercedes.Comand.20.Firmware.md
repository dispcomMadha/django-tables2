- Do not turn off the system or remove the USB drive during the update. This may cause damage to the system or corrupt the firmware file.
- If the update is interrupted or fails, try to restart the update by following the same steps as before. If the system does not recognize the USB drive or the firmware file, try to use a different USB drive or download the firmware file again.
- If the system does not boot up or function properly after the update, try to reset the system by pressing and holding the power button for 10 seconds. This may restore the system to its normal state.
- If none of the above steps work, contact your Mercedes-Benz dealer or customer service for assistance. They may be able to diagnose and fix the problem or provide you with a replacement system if necessary.
