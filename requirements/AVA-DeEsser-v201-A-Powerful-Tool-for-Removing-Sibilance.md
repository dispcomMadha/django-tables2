# AVA De-Esser v2.0.1: A Powerful Tool for Removing Sibilance
 
Sibilance is a common problem in vocal recordings, especially when using condenser microphones or close miking techniques. Sibilance refers to the harsh or hissing sounds that occur when pronouncing consonants like "s", "z", "sh", or "ch". Sibilance can make vocals sound unpleasant, distorted, or unnatural, and can also interfere with the clarity and intelligibility of the lyrics.

But how do you use AVA De-Esser v2.0.1 effectively? Here are some tips and tricks to get the best results from this plugin:
 
- Try level automation first. Before applying the de-esser, you can try to reduce the sibilance manually by lowering the volume of the problematic parts of the vocal track. This can give you more control and precision over the de-essing process.
- Use the listen mode. The listen mode allows you to hear only the frequencies that are being affected by the de-esser. This can help you to find the optimal frequency range and threshold settings for your vocal track.
- Adjust the amount knob. The amount knob controls how much gain reduction is applied to the sibilant frequencies. You can use it to fine-tune the intensity of the de-essing effect. A little goes a long way, so be careful not to overdo it.
- Use the output gain knob. The output gain knob allows you to compensate for any volume loss caused by the de-esser. You can use it to match the level of the original signal or to boost it slightly for more presence.

AVA De-Esser v2.0.1 is a versatile and powerful plugin that can help you to improve your vocal tracks by removing unwanted sibilance. It is easy to use, but also offers advanced features and options for more control and customization. Whether you are recording vocals for music, podcasts, voiceovers, or any other audio project, AVA De-Esser v2.0.1 can help you to achieve a smooth, clear, and natural sound.
